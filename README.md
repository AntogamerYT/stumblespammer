# Stumble Spammer

**A rewrite (yes, already) will be coming in the next days: this will make the bot faster and more precise**

This bot will help you spam Bug Bot, Stumble Guys' discord bug report bot

**I, ANTOGAMER, AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF YOUR DISCORD ACCOUNT BANS MADE FROM THIS USERBOT, PROCEED AT YOUR RISK! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING AN ALT**

## Requirements
Python 3.10+

A brain

## Installation

First of all, [get your account token](https://discordhelp.net/discord-token) (I suggest using an alt to avoid account bans), fill the TOKEN value of the .env.example file and rename it to .env

Open your preferred terminal in the project folder, you will need to execute a command depending on your platform:

Linux/Mac OS:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# if you dont have pip install python3-pip on Linux or python3 -m ensurepip on Mac OS
```

Windows:
```
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
# Same thing again, try to run py -m pip or py -m ensurepip if you dont have pip
```

To run use `py main.py` on Windows or `python3 main.py` on Linux/Mac OS
